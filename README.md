## forum engine
This is an online forum website where users can create threads in different topics, and they can post in markdown.

## todo
- markdown posting (because it would be nice to have formatting and images)
- topics page with truncated threads inside
- admin panel
- user roles
- temporary bans, perma-bans
- reply to a post (where the reply has a snippet of the OG post)
- text-search the site (results grouped by topic-thread or free-for-all)
- text-search the topic (results either grouped by thread or free-for-all)
- text-search the thread
- user avatars (submit a link, no image storage will be used)
- user signatures (markdown based)
- private messaging between users
- pinned threads
- possibly have folders(?) within topics
- docker setups for dev and prod
- ci/cd pipeline for prod
- (lowest priority) email verification during registration

## done (& tested)
- breeze auth
- style scheme for frontend (lightweight, but might change)
- paginated thread page (can view & create text-based posts)
- paginated profile page (with all the posts)
- header navigation (home, profile/login-register)
- topic page with paginated threads (20 per page)
- create thread in topic
